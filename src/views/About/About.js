              As a photographer & videographer I work with brands to produce
              digital content for their marketing strategies. In this rapid
              evolving technology world, I felt that I could bring more value to
              the entrepreneurs, so I wondered. What if all the experience I'd
              gained working as a creative could be synthesized into an exciting
              career in technology?. I was intrigued by the possibilities for a
              creator who knew how to code.
